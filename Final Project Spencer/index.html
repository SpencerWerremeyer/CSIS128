			<h1> Helpful Websites and How To's:</h1>
			<p><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/">Tom's Hardware</a> is a great place to look for builds and info from people who have done this before.
			They have how to's and a helpful community. They have a <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/t/build-your-own/">System Builder Marathon</a>
			that is all about building your own PC. Another good site to use is <a href="http://pcpartpicker.com/">pcpartpicker.com</a>. 
			It lets you pick parts for your computor and tells you if they are compatable. It even show the estimated wattage of the build which will 
			help pick a power supply. A good website for buying and comparing parts is <a href="http://www.newegg.com/">Newegg.</a>They have all the 
			parts that you would need and complete PC's.

			<h2>My Build:</h2>
				<p> I built a PC for gaming. I had a budget of $750
				and this is what I came up with.</p>
				<hr />
				<p> I started with the case. I chose a cougar spike because it was 
				small and cheap.<img class="left" src="img/spike.gif" alt="Cougar Spike Computer Case"/> After I picked the case I started looking at motherboards.
				I chose an ASUS B85M-E/CSM because it fit my case and had usb 3.0 connectors.
				My processor is an intel i-5 3 ghz. For ram I chose a G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB stick.
				I chose it because I will have the option to buy a second 8GB stick and have 16GB total. My 
				graphics card is an MSI 1060. It has 1 built in fan. My power supply is a Cosair
				cx500 500 watt. My HDD is a 1tb Western digital. I have 1 ASUS DVD reader and burner.
				<img class="right" src="img/devestator.jpg" alt="CM Storm Devestator Mouse and Keyboard"/> My keyboard and 
				mouse came in a bundle. They are the cm storm Devestator with blue led backlight.
