				There are two main types of storage devices, HDD and SSD.  HDD stands for hard disk drive.  SSD stands for Solid state drive.  HDDs have spiining metal disks inside them that tiny arms move accross to 
				store the data.  SSDs store data electricaly. HDD are rated by rpm of the disks speed.  The higher the RPM the faster the drive reads and writes.  SSDs are faster than HDDs but don't store as much data.
				HDDs can be affected by magnets. Some times people use SSDs for saving programs that they use a lot and HHD for programs that they don't want to lose.
